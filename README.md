# Maze Generation and Solving Visualizer
This is a Python-based visual application that generates mazes using recursive backtracking and solves them using various algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A*, and dynamic programming. The maze and the solving process are visualized using the Turtle graphics module.

##  Features
- Maze generation with Recursive Backtracking
- Visualization using Python Turtle graphics
- Multiple solving algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Dead-End Filling
- Performance analysis using matplotlib
- Simple GUI using Tkinter

##  Requirements
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

> Python's built-in libraries `tkinter`, `turtle`, `heapq`, `collections`, and `random` are also used.

##  How to Run
Run the main Python file:

```bash
python "Algorithms final project 2025 (2).py"
```

The application will open a GUI window with buttons to:
- Generate a new maze
- Solve the maze using different algorithms
- View performance statistics

##  Interface
- A `Turtle` window will display the maze and solving steps.
- A `Tkinter` window will provide controls and interaction.

##  File Structure
- `Algorithms final project 2025 (2).py` — Main script containing all generation, visualization, and algorithm logic.
